### LinkedArrayList
This is basically an "average" between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`, and is implemented as a linked list of small arrays. Each array/node has the same capacity generally called __degree__.
<h4>Future milestones</h4>
- [ ] Implement the entire `java.util.List` interface
- [ ] Implement the entire `java.util.Deque` interface
- [ ] Implement the entire `java.util.Iterable` interface (with `Spliterator`, etc)
- [ ] Experiment with another node type
- [ ] Implement `java.io.Serializable` interface

### xList
<h4>Future milestones</h4>
- [ ] Determine what `x` is
